# MegaTel
MegaTel is a team project in which I collaborated with 6 of my classmates as an end-year project for the subject "projet feder√© methode agile" for the second term of our second year in ISI Mahdia.
the project consists of developing a MegaTel calling center website with a homepage, signup and login interfaces that redirect the successfully logged-in users to the workspace. after a successful signup, the admin will be notified about the new user in his dashboard. only employees should be able to log in therefore the admin confirmation is necessary the new employee after verification of his identity will get his credentials by email which the admin sends. when successfully logged in the users will be asked to launch Discord app to enhance the working environment based on recommendations by the teacher and Discord will be launched directly  

steps to begin:
